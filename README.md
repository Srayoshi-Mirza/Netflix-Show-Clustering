**Project Name:**  
Netflix Content Clustering: A Data-Driven Approach to Content Strategy & Recommendation Systems

**Background:**  
Netflix hosts over 8,800 titles across movies and TV shows, serving 200+ million subscribers globally. Understanding content organization patterns is crucial for content acquisition strategy, recommendation systems, and competitive positioning. This project leverages unsupervised machine learning to uncover hidden patterns in Netflix's content library.

**Objective:**  
Apply K-means clustering to Netflix's catalog to identify distinct content groups, analyze their characteristics, and extract strategic insights for content strategy and recommendation system development.

**Goals:**
1. Implement robust clustering algorithm with silhouette score optimization
2. Discover 3-5 meaningful content segments with distinct characteristics
3. Identify strategic content gaps worth investigating for investment
4. Build foundation for similarity-based recommendation engine
5. Create portfolio-quality project demonstrating end-to-end ML skills

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clustered Netflix catalog with clear segment definitions
- Visual representations of content organization patterns
- Strategic insights report with business recommendations
- Documentation suitable for technical and non-technical audiences
- Reproducible code for portfolio demonstration
